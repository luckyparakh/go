		Capacity is larger than len
		Slice can have both diff and equal
		If you try to add additional values when the length equals the
		capacity, the append function uses the Go runtime to allocate a new backing array for
		the slice with a larger capacity. The values in the original backing array are copied
		to the new one, the new values are added to the end of the new backing array, and
		the slice is updated to refer to the new backing array. Finally, the updated slice is
		returned.
		The rule as of Go 1.18 is to double the capacity of a slice when the current capacity is less than 256. A
		bigger slice increases by (current_capacity + 768)/4. This slowly converges at 25%
		growth (a slice with capacity of 512 will grow by 63%, but a slice with capacity 4,096
		will grow by only 30%).
